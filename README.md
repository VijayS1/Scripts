Scripts
=======

This repository contains a collection of simple, unrelated scripts. Each subdirectory contains a different script or set of scripts.

## Scripts

*   **google-contacts/**: Contains a JavaScript bookmarklet to help manage Google Contacts. It allows selecting contacts based on criteria like having no name, email, or phone number.
*   **maketreezip/**: Contains a Python script, `makeTreeZip.py`, that creates a zip archive of a directory's structure without including the files' content. It can also be used to extract such archives.
*   **ssh-copy-id/**: Contains a set of scripts (Batch, VBScript, PowerShell) that replicate the functionality of the `ssh-copy-id` command on Windows, which is used to copy SSH public keys to a server for passwordless authentication. These scripts depend on `plink.exe`.
*   **whatsapp_bots/**: Contains a JavaScript bookmarklet for sending a configurable number of random emojis to a WhatsApp contact.

## Usage

Each script is self-contained and has its own usage instructions, which can be found in the `README.md` file within its respective directory.
